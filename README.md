you start with making the display in css : `flex`

 __*flex-direction*__, which has four possible values:

  -  **row**
  -  **row-reverse**
  -  **column**
  -  **column-reverse**

 _row_ or _row-reverse_, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.


_column_ or _column-reverse_ and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction.
